bin/update-manifest-skip
    Updates a MANIFEST.SKIP file from one or more sources (starting with the
    one in defaults/MANIFEST.SKIP).

bin/drac
    A command-line tool for launching the DRAC Virtual Console, without
    having to go through a web browser.  Especially useful on OS X and Linux
    where the DRAC web interface doesn't always work so great.
